        "# Mathematical Model for Acoustic Replication of Traditional Sasando\n",

        "## 0. Abstract\n",
        "\n",
        "This document presents a mathematical model for replicating the acoustic characteristics of the traditional sasando instrument in electric versions. The model employs a dual Fourier series representation to capture both the harmonic structure of the string vibration and the frequency-dependent amplification effects of the resonator. The approach extracts parameters from reference acoustic signals and applies them to transform electric sasando input signals, preserving the instrument's characteristic timbre while maintaining the electric instrument's pitch and timing.\n"

        "\n",
        "The traditional sasando is an Indonesian string instrument where sound is produced by vibrating strings that are acoustically amplified through a hand-formed, dried lontar leaf resonator. This unique resonator naturally amplifies frequencies between 98 Hz and 1047 Hz, creating the instrument's characteristic acoustic timbre. Modern electric versions replace the acoustic resonator with a pickup and speaker system, sacrificing acoustic quality for portability.\n",
        "\n",
        "This work presents a mathematical model that enables electric sasando signals to replicate the acoustic characteristics of the traditional instrument. The model decomposes the acoustic signal into its harmonic components and models the resonator's contribution as a frequency-dependent transformation, providing a foundation for real-time sound synthesis in electric instruments.\n",

        "The mathematical model is based on the following assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Harmonic Structure**: The signal can be represented as a sum of harmonics (integer multiples of the fundamental frequency). Inharmonic partials are negligible or approximated by nearby harmonics.\n",

        "2. **Linear Resonator Model**: The resonator's effect is modeled as a linear transformation with frequency-dependent amplitude scaling $\\alpha_n$ and constant phase shift $\\theta$. The resonator behaves linearly without significant non-linear distortion.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Exponential Decay**: The amplitude envelope follows an exponential decay model $A_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$. The decay is uniform across all harmonics and the decay time constant $\\tau$ is constant throughout the signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Stationary Signal**: The signal characteristics (fundamental frequency, harmonic amplitudes, phases) are stationary over the analysis window, except for the exponential decay envelope.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Perfect Harmonic Alignment**: All frequency components are exact integer multiples of the fundamental frequency $f_0$.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Noise-Free Extraction**: Noise and continuous spectral content do not significantly affect the extraction of harmonic amplitudes and phases.\n",
