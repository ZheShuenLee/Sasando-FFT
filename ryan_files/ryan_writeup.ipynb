        "\n",
        "The mathematical model is based on the following assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Harmonic Structure**: The signal can be accurately represented as a sum of harmonics (integer multiples of the fundamental frequency). This assumes that inharmonic partials are negligible or can be approximated by nearby harmonics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Linear Resonator Model**: The resonator's effect is modeled as a linear transformation with frequency-dependent amplitude scaling $\\alpha_n$ and constant phase shift $\\theta$. This assumes the resonator behaves linearly and does not introduce significant non-linear distortion.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Exponential Decay**: The amplitude envelope follows an exponential decay model $A_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$. This assumes that the decay is uniform across all harmonics and that the decay time constant $\\tau$ is constant throughout the signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Stationary Signal**: The signal characteristics (fundamental frequency, harmonic amplitudes, phases) are assumed to be stationary over the analysis window, except for the exponential decay envelope.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Perfect Harmonic Alignment**: The model assumes that all frequency components are exact integer multiples of the fundamental frequency $f_0$. In reality, slight frequency variations may occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Noise-Free Extraction**: The feature extraction process assumes that noise and continuous spectral content do not significantly affect the extraction of harmonic amplitudes and phases.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Resonator Frequency Response**: The resonator's frequency response is approximated by a step function:\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   \\alpha_n = \\begin{cases}\n",
        "       0.8 & \\text{if } 98 \\text{ Hz} \\leq n \\cdot f_0 \\leq 1047 \\text{ Hz} \\\\\n",

        "   $$\n",
        "   This is a simplification of the actual complex frequency response.\n",
        "\n",
